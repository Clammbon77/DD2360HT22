This is the final project on Unified memory optimization of bfs in Rodinia3.1 suite for DD2360HT22 Applied GPU programming.
=========================
1. Pakage Structure

/bin		: binary executables
/common	: common configuration file
/bfs	: source code for the CUDA implementation of bfs 
/bfs_um  : source code for the CUDA implementation of bfs with UM optimization
/bfs_adv  : source code for the CUDA implementation of bfs with advise UM optimization
/bfs_um_pre  : source code for the CUDA implementation of bfs with prefetch UMoptimization 
/data	: input files
/DD2360_project : notebook including history of coding

2. Build bfs
Using make

3. run bfs 
Can be run on the graph contained in the data folder graph1MW_6.txt
For example: ./bfs ../../data/bfs/graph1MW_6.txt
